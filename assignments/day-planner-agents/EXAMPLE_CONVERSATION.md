Based on the weather conditions, I'd recommend the following clothing items for today:

- A lightweight, short-sleeved shirt to keep you cool in the 65Â°F weather.
- A pair of comfortable, breathable pants or jeans to match the partly cloudy skies.
- And, a lightweight jacket or sweater to layer on for any slight breeze.

Have a great day!

Considering the weather conditions, here are some activity recommendations for you:

- Since it's partly cloudy, why not visit the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana? The museum features a diverse collection of art and cultural exhibits.
- Take a stroll along the Santa Ana River Trail, a 12-mile path that follows the river and offers great views of the surrounding area.
- If you're feeling adventurous, head over to the Lyon Air Museum in nearby Santa Ana Heights, which showcases a collection of historic aircraft and military vehicles.

I hope you find something that suits your interests!

Based on your location in Santa Ana, California, and the current weather conditions, I'd be happy to recommend some great places to eat. Here are three suggestions:

- **The Beachcomber**: This coastal-inspired restaurant is perfect for a sunny winter afternoon. Enjoy their seafood dishes, like fish tacos or grilled shrimp, on their outdoor patio.
- **Bistro Papillote**: This charming French-Vietnamese bistro is a great spot for a casual dinner. Try their pho or banh mi, and don't forget to leave room for their delicious crepes.
- **Cha Cha's Latin Kitchen**: This vibrant eatery serves up flavorful Latin-inspired dishes, like carne asada tacos or chile relleno. Their outdoor patio is a great spot to enjoy the mild winter weather.

I hope you find something that suits your taste!
