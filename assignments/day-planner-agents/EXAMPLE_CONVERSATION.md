Based on the weather information, I recommend the following clothing items:

• A lightweight, breathable top such as a cotton blouse or a tank top
• Comfortable, lightweight pants or a flowy skirt for a relaxed, sunny day
• A pair of sandals or flip-flops for warm weather
• A light jacket or sweater for layering, in case the temperature drops slightly

Please note that this is just a suggestion, and you should feel free to adjust based on your personal preferences and the activities you plan on doing.

Based on the current weather conditions, I'd recommend the following cuisines and places to eat in Santa Ana, California:

• Lunch: For a sunny day like today, I suggest trying some delicious Mexican food at Solita Tacos & Margaritas. Their carne asada tacos are a hit!
• Snack: Since it's partly cloudy, I'd recommend grabbing a refreshing gelato at Salt & Straw. Their unique flavors like honey lavender and earl grey will surely hit the spot!
• Dinner: For a later dinner, consider trying some tasty Korean BBQ at Sura Korean BBQ. Their BBQ menu features a wide range of marinated meats, including bulgogi, kalbi, and more!

Hope you enjoy your day and your meals in Santa Ana!
